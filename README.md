R Programming assignment
(1)	Generate 100 random samples from a univariate normal distribution (default parameters), and compute mean, sd, variance, median, and standard quantiles. Report the quantities.
(2)	Plot histogram (experiment with breaks parameter), include only one best plot.
(3)	As the data is generated from a normal distribution, one would expect that the data follow a normal distribution, but how to test it. Try “qqnorm” function (understand it first), include your plot. Comment on if the data follows a normal distribution (why or why not)?
(4)	Generate data (100 samples) for 2 random variable (height and weight; that is 2d data) using reasonable parameters. Using this 2d data to, (a) generate summary statistics, (b) generate a bar plots, (c) generate box plots, and (d) generate a scatter plot
(5)	Plot normal distribution for each variable (height and weight) from the 2d data generated above (10.4)
(6)	Plot bivariate normal distribution for the above data (data generated in (10.4)).
